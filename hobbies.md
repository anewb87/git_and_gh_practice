My hobbies in the summertime include hiking, playing pick-up sports games, camping, and doing anything outside really.
My hobbies in the wintertime include staying warm, wearing as many pairs of socks as I can put on my feet, drinking hot apple cider, watching the snow fall, and occasionally walking outside to get the mail. ;)
